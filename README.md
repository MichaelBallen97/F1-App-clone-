## Web Scraping

The project uses web scraping techniques to obtain updated Formula 1 data. We use the following technologies:

- **Playwright**: For browser automation and data extraction
- **Chromium**: As headless browser for scraping

The information is obtained ethically and respecting the terms of use and robots.txt of the official Formula 1 website.
